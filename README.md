# Portfolio Website 

## Project Overview
This project was created as part of the HTML and CSS course. It is a personal portfolio website built using basic HTML and CSS, showcasing my understanding of web structure and styling principles. The project focuses on clean layout, interactivity, and user engagement through subtle design features.

## Features
- **Responsive Design:** Structured layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Hover Effects:** Smooth hover animations added to enhance the visual appeal.
- **Recommendation Tab:** A section where users can submit their opinions or feedback about me, which then gets displayed on the page.
- **Simple and Clean UI:** Prioritized readability and a user-friendly experience.
